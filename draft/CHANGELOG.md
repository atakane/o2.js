**[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** Change Log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO: edit me!

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.26

v.0.26 is not up there yet. Here are a few major things that will change
most of the codebase:

* We'll be removing active support of IE versions less than 10,
* We'll be using AMD (require.js.

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.25

* Started working on converting all the o2.js modules to AMD modules.

This version will be **frozen** once the following are installed/done
	* grunt,
	* require.js as a submodule,
	* a code coverage tool,
	* a modern documentation tool,
	* empty jasmine test specs for each module,
	* updates on jshint and other bathces.

When we're done with this, this version (which is on dev branch) will be
merged with master and tagged.

Then we'll move forward to v.0.26, where there will be other **major** changes
such as [removing support from IE9 and older](https://github.com/v0lkan/o2.js/issues/112)
browsers.

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.24

* This version has been actually used in a **mobile** and **desktop** app
production environments (for <http://grou.ps/> mobile and desktop apps, that
has been used and tested by hundreds of thousands of users).
The code is improved and got fixed by looking at user feedback and bug reports
accordingly. I'd like to thank <http://grou.ps> once more for their support
in **open source** development.
* Many stability improvments have been done.
* Created a set of unit test, that can be run automatically before each
major release.
