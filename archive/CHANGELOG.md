**[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** Change Log
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.2.0.0

This new version will be **highly incompatible** with the current code base (hence it has been given a new major version number: **2**)

- All the code will be written in **CommonJS** (*i.e., Node.JS*) format;
- Everything will be highly modular;
- We'll be removing active support of IE versions less than 10;
- We'll be using an AMD approach (either using require.js or a custom AMD implementation;
that supports (or is similar to) require.js API;
- And more&hellip;

[Switch to the dev branch to see what's coming up next](https://github.com/v0lkan/o2.js/tree/dev).

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.25

We are tagging **v.0.25.8** as a release.

> If you want to contribute to the **0.x.x** codebase, please [branch off from the most recent **0.x.x** tag](https://github.com/v0lkan/o2.js/releases).
>
> However, **a huge amount of help** is needed in the **dev** branch right now, and we'd love to see you there.

### **[o2.js](http://o2js.com/)** v.0.24

* This version has been actually used in a **mobile** and **desktop** app
production environments (for <http://grou.ps/> mobile and desktop apps, that
has been used and tested by hundreds of thousands of users).
The code is improved and got fixed by looking at user feedback and bug reports
accordingly. I'd like to thank <http://grou.ps> once more for their support
in **open source** development.
* Many stability improvments have been done.
* Created a set of unit test, that can be run automatically before each
major release.
